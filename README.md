# Money Chirp

Using a database of publicly traded companies, a user can create a unique profile to follow a companies stock price and twitter trending score.
The app will give the user a sense of weather or not a stock may tank or strike up in the market if there is a high trending score. The user will 
be able to add companies and delete companies to follow through an autocomplete search.
